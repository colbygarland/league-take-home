# League Coding Challenge

Thank you for your interest in League, and especially for taking the time to work on this coding challenge.

We value and respect your time, so **we recommend capping your effort on this challenge at 4 hours**. We will be reviewing your code with you if you're invited to an in-person interview.

Try to have fun with it! We'd like to see your problem solving skills and how familiar you are with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the most successful candidates are able to demonstrate their development perspective and personality in the challenge. Use whatever JavaScript ecosystem and setup you like. One library we like at League is styled-components and we build our stuff in React.

### Requirements

- Please do not put your code in a public repository!
- In the root folder, please include a `README` with instructions on how to build and start your project.
- Include your name in your project folder, like `first-last-league/` or similar.
- Upload the source code of your completed solution someplace you can share it with us like Dropbox, Google Drive, your own server etc. (not iCloud, please). We are happy to run it locally so you don't need to deploy it to a server, though that would be cool!
- To keep file-size down, don't forget to remove any dependencies (eg. `node_modules`) from your folder!
- Include a README.md with a list of trade-offs and assumptions you are making.
- Ensure that your solution has tests. We are interested in seeing your approach to testing

## Photo Album App

Create a JavaScript application that allows a user to navigate photo albums. You can use the following user stories to help guide your design:

### User stories

1. As a user, I would like to see a list of my own albums along with their titles.
2. As someone interested in a particular album, I would like to see thumbnails of the photos in an album along with their titles.
3. As a user, I want to search for photo titles for a specific string. I would like the results returned to have the entire word italicized that matches the search parameter. Consider only single word search use cases and assume no special characters beyond just alphabetical characters. For example:
   1. If I were to search for "accu", the results would show the entire word "*accusamus*" as italicized.
   2. If I were to search for "fun" and there's a title with "refunds are not a fun time", the title would be displayed as "*refunds* are not a *fun* time". Both the word "refunds" and the word "fun" would be italicized. 
   3. If I were to search for "fun", a string with the following substring would **not** be italicized "...fu n..."
