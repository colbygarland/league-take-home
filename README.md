# League Coding Challenge

## Author: Colby Garland

### Setup and running the project

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to run the project :)
- Run `yarn test` to run the tests (sadly I did not get this far)

### Trade-offs and Assumptions

So with the time cap at 4 hours, I thought that was _fairly_ generous in terms of getting the basic features working. As you can tell, I ran out of time for tests (I usually don't do test-driven development, but I can see in cases like this how important that can be!)

I am doing a bit of caching the results, which seem to work fairly good. Obviously this approach is not well-implemented, and there is some duplication of photos which could be better done, but I wanted to stick within the time limit.
